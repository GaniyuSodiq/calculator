This project is meant to test my HTML, CSS and Javascript foundational skills.

I am ready for the challenge

I am glad to get to the last project in the foundations part of the Odin program

I cant wait to start the advance part.



// EDIT

THE PROBLEM
23+5

need to store the number at RHS inside a variable
need to store the number at the LHS inside a variable
need to use the operator between the numbers to calculate

once + is clicked, store the number on screen to LHS variable
then store the operator too
then clear screen

once = is clicked, store the number on screen to RHS variable
clear the screen
then operate the variable based on the operator (e.g +)
and display the result

IT IS AMAZING HOW I AM ABLE TO FIGURE THE SOLUTION TO THE
CHALLENGES IN THIS PROJECT WITH JUST FEW THINKING.
